## Biomedical predicate classification using SemMedDB

![BioPREP_Overview](/Users/gibonghong/gbhong.github.io/assets/images/BioPREP_Overview.png)

- Relation extraction for biomedical text sequence after building open dataset  
   \- Opened dataset, **BioPREP**, with 165,799 sentences, each labeled with 28 predicates.  
   \- Built fine-tuned classification model based on BioBERT.  
   \- Analyzed by clustering 28 predicates into 7 semantic groups based on FrameNet.  

## Personalized conversational agent with user persona and dialogue history

- Building personalized conversation model with graph-embedded information of the speaker.  
   \- 3-stage process: 1) User attributes extraction from dialogue, 2) Knowledge graph embedding with extracted attributes, 3) dialog generation with vectors from graph.  
   \- Built BART-based summarization model to extract user attributes from given dialogue.  
   \- Developing methods to generate dialogue with graph-embedded user features.
