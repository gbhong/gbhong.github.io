Hello, Iâ€™m Gibong Hong!

I am a first-year PhD student in the School of Information Science at University of Illnois, Urbana-Champaign. I am now working as an NLP researcher in [BioNLP Group](http://deeptext.yonsei.ac.kr) with my advisor Prof. [Halil Kilicoglu](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/halil-kilicoglu) and in [Social Computing Lab](http://jdiesnerlab.ischool.illinois.edu) with my advisor Prof. [Jana Diesner](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/jana-diesner)

My primary research interests lie in the *application of natural language processing (NLP)*. Specifically, I am intersted in Information Extraction (Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction) and Knowledge-enhanced Text Generation. Applying these methodologies to biomedical, social, and educational field would enhance the accuracy and explainability of the AI system at the same time. For my long-term goal, I hope that I can contribute to building an automated system with multi-step reasoning, not only making an logical approach to achieve an answer but also helping users understand the model's decision.
