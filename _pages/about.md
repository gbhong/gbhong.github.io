Hello, Iâ€™m Gi Bong Hong!

I am a second-year master's student in the Digital Analytics at Yonsei University. I am now working as an NLP researcher in [Deep Text Lab](http://deeptext.yonsei.ac.kr) with my supervisor Prof. [Min Song](http://informatics.yonsei.ac.kr/tsmm/minsong.html). 

My primary research interests lie in the *application of natural language processing (NLP)*. My long-term goal is to build a system that can deeply understand human language, reason about it, and solve problems in realistic settings. Toward this goal, I hope to work on extracting information from text and building personalized dialogue system.
