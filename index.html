    <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Gi Bong Hong!</p>
    <p>I am a second-year master's student in the Digital Analytics at Yonsei University.</p>
    <p>I am now working as an NLP researcher in the <a href="http://deeptext.yonsei.ac.kr">Deep Text Lab</a>, with my supervisor Prof. <a href="http://informatics.yonsei.ac.kr/tsmm/minsong.html">Min Song</a>.</p>
    <p>My research interests lie in the application of natural language processing (NLP). The long-term goal of my research is to build a human-level reasoning system that can deeply understand our language to solve problems in realistic settings. To achieve this goal, my plan is to work on (1) Information Extraction and (2) a personalized Conversational AI. </p>
